// ## Problem One 
// a. Write a `while` loop that takes the variable `num` and logs all the numbers, descending, between "num" and 1

// b. Write a `for` loop that takes the variable `num` and logs all the numbers, descending, between "num" and 1


// ## Problem Two
// a. Write a `while` loop that takes the variable "max", and iterates over all numbers from 0 to "max". 
// For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and log that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even")

// b. Use a `for` loop instead


// ## Problem Three

// a. Write a `while` loop that takes the variable "x" and iterates over all numbers from 0 to "x". For each iteration of the loop, it will multiply the number of "x" by 9 and log the result 

// b. Use a `for` loop instead.

// Write a `while` loop and a `for` loop that takes the variable "x" and iterates over all numbers from 0 to "x". For each iteration of the loop, it will multiply the number of "x" by 9 and log the result (e.g. "2 * 9 = 18").


// ## Problem Four

// Write code that prints/logs all the numbers that end in a 5 from 1 to 100, **exclusive**.


// ## Problem Five

// Without running/executing your code, how many times will the loop below run? Explain why.

// let i = 5;

// while (i > 3) {
//     i += 1
// }

// // Your explanation here


// ## Problem Six

// Write a loop that uses console.log to log all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, log "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), log "Buzz" instead.


// ## Problem Seven

// Modify your program to log "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (still log "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).


// ## Problem Eight

// Write a program that would log the [lyrics of the song 99 Bottles of Beer](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html). This is the first verse of the song:

//   ```
//   99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
//   Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
//   ```

// This verse is repeated, each time with one less bottle, until the number of bottles is 0. When the number of bottles is 2, the verse is:

//   ```
//   2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
//   Take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall.
//   ```

//   In the last line, the word bottles (plural), is  replaced with bottle (singular)

//   When the number of bottles is 1, the verse is:

//   ```
//   1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
//   Take one down, pass it around, No more bottle of beer on the wall.
//   ```


// ## Problem Nine

// Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

//   Hint 1 
//   Try printing/logging a single line of * first.

//   Hint 2
//   You will need 2 loops for this.


// ## Problem Ten

// If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

// Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
